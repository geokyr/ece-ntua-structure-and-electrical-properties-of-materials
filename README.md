## Semester Project

The semester project aimed at giving a practical insight on the electrical properties of materials. The project was divided into five questions, that covered the topics that follow.

- Energy Gaps in Semiconductors
- Fermi-Dirac Distribution
- Electron and Hole Density in Semiconductors
- Law of Mass Action
- Electron Density in Impure Semiconductors

## Lab Assignments

There were 2 lab assignments in total. The first one was an introduction to the lab equipment and had a few basic questions and experiments, including measuring resistances, using a multimeter and using the oscilloscope to calculate frequencies. The second one was more advanced and included diodes, capacitors, RC circuits, Half-Wave and Full-Wave Rectifiers, Signal Smoothing and Peak Detection.
